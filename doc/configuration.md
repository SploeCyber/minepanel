# Configuration

![Configuration](/img/configuration.webp)

## Environment Variables

The Compose files only declare the core variables. **Optional features (SMTP password
recovery, OIDC/SSO, ...) are read from your `.env` file** via `env_file`, so you don't need
to edit `docker-compose.yml` to enable them — just add the variables to `.env`. See
[`.env.example`](https://github.com/Ketbome/minepanel/blob/main/.env.example) for the full list.

### Required

| Variable     | Description                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Auth secret. Generate: `openssl rand -base64 32` |

### Ports & Directories

| Variable        | Default | Description               |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | `3000`  | Web UI port               |
| `BACKEND_PORT`  | `8091`  | API port                  |
| `BASE_DIR`      | auto-detected | Host path that maps to `/app`. Auto-detected from the `/app/servers` mount; the env var is only a fallback for local dev / non-Docker runs |
| `BACKUP_BASE_DIR` | _(empty)_ | Optional host path for backups (e.g. `/network-disk/minepanel`). Empty keeps the default `${BASE_DIR}/servers/<id>/backups`. Can be overridden per server in the UI |
| `COMPOSE_PROJECT` | _(empty)_ | Optional prefix for per-server Docker Compose project names (`<prefix>_<serverId>`) |

### Authentication

| Variable          | Default | Description    |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------------- |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | `15m` | **Deprecated.** Overrides the access token TTL (`20s`, `1h`, `2d`). Sessions already stay alive through the 7-day refresh token, renewed on every use, so leave it unset; the backend logs a warning when it is set and the variable will be removed in a future release |
| `ALLOW_INSECURE_AUTH_COOKIES` | `false` | Set `true` only for HTTP/LAN access when browsers block auth cookies |

Minepanel no longer uses default credentials from environment variables. The first visit to the panel opens a setup screen where you create the initial admin account.

### Password Recovery

::: tip Configurable from the panel
SMTP and OIDC can now be managed from **Settings → Integrations** (admin only), stored
**encrypted** in the database. The variables below are still supported as a fallback; a value
set in the panel **overrides** the matching variable. Secrets are write-only (never returned
to the browser).
:::

| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `SMTP_HOST` | _(empty)_ | SMTP server hostname |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `587` | SMTP port |
| `SMTP_SECURE` | `false` | Use `true` for SMTPS/465, `false` for STARTTLS/587 |
| `SMTP_USER` | _(empty)_ | SMTP username |
| `SMTP_PASS` | _(empty)_ | SMTP password |
| `SMTP_FROM` | _(empty)_ | Sender shown in password reset emails |
| `PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN_MINUTES` | `60` | Password reset link lifetime in minutes |

### Single Sign-On (OIDC)

Optional. Enabled only when `OIDC_ISSUER`, `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` and
`OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` are all set. Works with any OpenID Connect provider (Authentik, Authelia,
Keycloak, Google, ...). See the [Single Sign-On](/sso) guide for setup.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `OIDC_ISSUER` | _(empty)_ | Provider issuer URL (endpoints are auto-discovered) |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | _(empty)_ | OAuth2 client ID |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | _(empty)_ | OAuth2 client secret (kept server-side only) |
| `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` | _(empty)_ | Backend callback, e.g. `https://api.example.com/auth/oidc/callback` |
| `OIDC_SCOPES` | `openid email profile` | Space-separated scopes |
| `OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME` | `SSO` | Label shown on the login button |
| `OIDC_DISABLE_PASSWORD_LOGIN` | `false` | `true` hides and blocks password login (SSO only) |

### URLs

| Variable                       | Default                 | Description                  |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `FRONTEND_URL`                 | `http://localhost:3000` | Controls CORS                |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`      | `http://localhost:8091` | API URL for frontend         |
| `BASE_PATH`                    | _(empty)_               | Backend API prefix such as `/api` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`        | _(empty)_               | Frontend route prefix such as `/minepanel` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE` | `en`                    | `en`, `es`, `nl`, `de`, `pl`, `fr`, `ru`, `pt`, `tr` |

::: danger CORS
`FRONTEND_URL` **must match** how you access the panel. Mismatch = blocked requests.
:::

::: warning Authentication over HTTP
In production, authentication cookies are secure by default. If you access Minepanel over plain HTTP (for example via local IP), browsers may reject secure cookies and login can get stuck on **"Verifying authentication..."**.

You can explicitly opt in to HTTP auth cookies with:

```bash
ALLOW_INSECURE_AUTH_COOKIES=true
```

Use this only for trusted LAN/development environments. Prefer HTTPS whenever possible.

## Network Settings

Public IP, LAN IP and everything about the Java proxy are configured through the
web UI, under **Settings → Network**. Since 1.12 the panel runs mc-router itself,
so none of this lives in `.env` any more:

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Base domain | Wildcard domain servers get hostnames under (`<id>.mc.example.com`) |
| Enable proxy | Starts or stops the mc-router container |
| Router port | Host port the proxy listens on (25565 by default) |
| Auto-scaling | Stops proxied Java servers while empty, starts them on the first connection |
| Stop after | Idle time before a server is stopped (`10m` by default) |
| Sleeping server message | MOTD shown while a server is stopped |
| Extra Docker networks | Existing external networks to attach the router to, one per line |

Auto-scaling can be turned off for one server without turning it off for the
rest, under **Server → Network → Proxy Settings**.

## Advanced

### Base Directory (host path)

`BASE_DIR` is the **absolute host path** that maps to `/app` inside the container — the directory
that holds `servers/` and `data/`. Because each Minecraft server runs through the host Docker
daemon (via the mounted socket), the generated compose files use host paths built from this
value, not container paths.

You normally **don't need to set it**: at startup Minepanel asks Docker for the real host source
of the `/app/servers` mount and uses it, so the path always matches wherever you mounted the
data. The `BASE_DIR` env var is only a fallback for local dev or non-Docker runs:

```bash
BASE_DIR=/mnt/external/minepanel
```

If you set `BASE_DIR` and it doesn't match the detected mount, Minepanel logs a warning and uses
the detected path. This is why custom composes that mounted data into a subdirectory (e.g.
`./minepanel/servers:/app/servers`) no longer end up writing servers to the wrong host folder.

### Multiple Instances

Run on different ports:

```bash
# Instance 1
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
BACKEND_PORT=8091

# Instance 2
FRONTEND_PORT=3001
BACKEND_PORT=8092
```

### Subdirectory Routing

Use these variables when Minepanel is served behind a reverse proxy under subpaths instead of the domain root.

| Variable | What it affects | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` | Frontend URLs generated by Next.js | `/minepanel` |
| `BASE_PATH` | Backend route prefix in NestJS | `/api` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` | Full backend URL used by the frontend | `https://mydomain.com/api` |

Example for `https://mydomain.com/minepanel` talking to `https://mydomain.com/api`:

```yaml
# docker-compose.development.yml
frontend:
  build:
    args:
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/minepanel
  environment:
    - NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/minepanel
    - NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://mydomain.com/api

backend:
  environment:
    - BASE_PATH=/api
```

::: warning
`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` changes the Next.js `basePath`, so it must be present at build time. For custom Docker builds, keep the runtime value aligned with the build arg so healthchecks and diagnostics use the same path.
:::

::: info
Prebuilt frontend images cannot switch to a different `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` at runtime only. If you need `/minepanel`, build the frontend image with that value.
:::

::: warning Published ports are reachable on every interface
`docker-compose.yml` publishes the backend on `${BACKEND_PORT:-8091}` and the frontend on
`${FRONTEND_PORT:-3000}` without binding them to an address, so Docker listens on `0.0.0.0`
and both containers are reachable directly from anywhere that can route to the host. A reverse
proxy in front of them does not change that: `http://<host-ip>:8091/...` still reaches the API,
bypassing the proxy's TLS, its access rules, and — because the prefix lives in the proxy path —
`BASE_PATH` itself.

That is fine on a host where nothing else can reach those ports, and it is how the default
compose is meant to work for a plain LAN install. On a host with a cloud firewall that permits
inbound traffic (a VPS or a cloud VM), narrow the published ports to the loopback interface
unless you deliberately want direct access:

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yml - merged on top of docker-compose.yml automatically
# `!override` replaces the inherited port list; needs Compose 2.24.4 or later.
services:
  backend:
    ports: !override
      - '127.0.0.1:${BACKEND_PORT:-8091}:8091'
  frontend:
    ports: !override
      - '127.0.0.1:${FRONTEND_PORT:-3000}:3000'
```

Check the merged result rather than trusting the snippet:

```bash
docker compose config
```

The reverse proxy runs on the same host and connects over loopback, so it keeps working; the
containers stay on the `minepanel-network` bridge for everything else. Put the override in
`docker-compose.override.yml` rather than editing `docker-compose.yml`, so a `git pull` does not
overwrite it.
